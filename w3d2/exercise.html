1. Determine what this Javascript code will print out (without running it):

x = 1;
var a = 5;
var b = 10;
var c = function(a, b, c) {
    var x = 10;
    document.write(x);
    document.write(a);
    var f = function(a, b, c) {
        b = a;
        document.write(b);
        b = c;
        var x = 5;
    }
    f(a,b,c);
    document.write(b);
}
c(8,9,10);
document.write(b);
document.write(x);

Ans1: 10889101

2. What is the difference between a method and function?

Ans2: Method is a function with a defined this.

3. What does 'this' refer to when used in a Java method?

The class which the method is in.

4. What does 'this' refer to when used in a JavaScript method?

the constext (calling object)

5. What does 'this' refer to when used in a JavaScript constructor function?

According to W3Schools:
In a constructor function this does not have a value. It is a substitute for the new object. The value of this will become the new object when a new object is created.

6. Assume object x is the prototype for object y in Javascript. Object x has a method f( ) containing keyword 'this'.
When f is called by x.f( ), what does 'this' refer to?

object y

7. What is a free variable in JavaScript?

variable not locally declared or passed

8. Create an object that has properties with name = "fred" and major="music" and a property that is a function
that takes 2 numbers and returns the smallest of the two, or the square of the two if they are equal.

var myobj = {
    name: "fred",
    major: "music",
    calc: function(a, b) {
        if(a==b) return a*b;
        return Math.min(a,b);
    }
}

9. Write Javascript code for creating three Employee objects using the "new" keyword and a constructor function.
Employee objects have the following fields: name, salary, position.

function Employee(name, salary, position) {
    this.name = name;
    this.salary = salary;
    this.position = position;
}
var e = new Employee("Ammar", 600000, "CEO");


10. Write a Javascript function that takes any number of input arguments and returns the product of the
arguments.

function productAll() {
    var res = 1;
    for (var i=0; i&lt;arguments.length; i++) {
        res *= arguments[i];
    }
    return res;
}

11. Write an arrow function that returns the maximum of its three input arguments
var max = (a, b, c) => Math.max(a, Math.max(b,c));
